# HSV_ColorFinder
Uses OpenCV to find the HSV values of a certain color. Put the object that you would like to find the specific HSV values of in front of your webcam and then adjust the sliders until the item is completely white and the background is completeley black. There isn't a correct method to doing this right, it just takes a lot of trial and error. 

# What I Learned 
- applying masks in real-time 
- using HSV values for color detection
- Utilizing track bars in OpenCV
